# Computer Vision Takehome 01

## Project Overview

This project contains a set of computer vision tasks implemented in Python using OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Each task demonstrates fundamental image processing techniques such as intensity reduction, filtering, and more. The code is organized in Jupyter notebooks for easy experimentation and visualization.
